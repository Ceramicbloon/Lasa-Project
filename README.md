Disclaimer:
I am by no means a graphic artist.

I don't know how to use a online drawing program for my icons, nor I am able to draw them.

However, I am good at importing from flaticon.

All the icons I used are from flaticon, and attributes are below:

I also took some equations from the internet because I know nothing about calculus, physics, and other kinds of advanced subjects.

Everything else is purely by me.
